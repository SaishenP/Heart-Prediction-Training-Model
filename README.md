# Heart-Prediction-Training-Model
Created a Heart Disease Prediction Model using Jupyter notebook for data analysis and python to create the streamlit application 

import numpy as np                                          #to convert data into numpy arrays
import pandas as pd                                         #for data pre-processing technique and importing our data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                             #for creating data visualizations to explore the data
import seaborn as sns                                       #for making such visualizations and creating plots
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split        #to divide our original data into training data and testing data
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression         #to build our regression type ml model from sklearn import metrics 
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score                  #to evaluate the accuracy of our ml model

have to install all necessary packages using pip install scikit-learn, joblib, numpy and streamlit.
